  <h2 class="heading_box">Fostering</h2>Stray fostering involves temporarily caring for stray animals in your home until a permanent placement can be found for them. This can include dogs, cats, or other animals that have been abandoned, lost, or surrendered. Stray fostering typically involves providing basic care such as food, water, shelter, and companionship, as well as any necessary medical attention. Fostering helps give these animals a safe and loving environment while they await adoption or reunification with their owners. It also helps alleviate overcrowding in shelters and gives the animals a better chance at finding permanent homes.</div>

    <h2 class="heading_box">Adoption</h2>Stray adoption refers to the process of providing a permanent home for a stray animal that has been rescued or found. When stray animals are taken in by shelters or rescue organizations, they are often made available for adoption once they receive necessary medical care, vaccinations, and behavior assessments. Potential adopters can visit the shelter or organization to meet the animals available for adoption and find one that matches their lifestyle and preferences. Adopting a stray animal not only provides them with a loving home but also helps reduce the stray population and promotes responsible pet ownership.</div></div>
