            I adopted my furry best friend from Stray Stop, and I couldn't be happier! The staff was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable, guiding me through the adoption process with ease. My new pet came home healthy, happy, and ready to join our family. Thank you, Stray Stop, for making the adoption experience so positive!

            As a foster caregiver for Stray Stop, I've had the privilege of providing temporary homes to several amazing animals.  The organization's support and resources have been invaluable, ensuring that both the animals and I have everything we need. It's heartwarming to see these strays thrive and find forever homes thanks to the dedication of Stray Stop

            I've adopted two dogs from Stray Stop over the years, and I'm continually impressed by the organization's commitment to the well-being of animals.  Both of my pets were rescued from difficult situations and given a second chance at life thanks to Stray Stop's efforts. I highly recommend adopting from them if you're looking to add a furry friend to your family!
